# Stock Price App

### Overview
The Stock Price App is a simple web application built for my CS 20 Web Programming course. It demonstrates full-stack integration by parsing CSV data on MongoDB and returning results to a client-side interface.

---

### What It Does
- **Reads stock data** from a CSV file containing company names and prices  
- **Runs a Node.js server** (`server.js`) that loads the CSV and serves requests  
- **Implements client-side JavaScript** (`pt1.js`) to handle input and display results  
- **Returns the matching stock price** for the company entered by the user  

---

### Built With
- **Node.js** – server-side logic for handling requests and reading CSV data  
- **JavaScript** – client-side script for making requests and updating the UI  
- **HTML/CSS** – structure and styling for the front end  
- **CSV file** – source of company and stock price data  
- **Procfile** – configuration for deployment on platforms like Heroku *(deployment now expired)*

This short video shows me clearing the `PublicCompanies` collection, running my app, and verifying that the database is repopulated with new stock data.
